</title></head><body>
<p>Originally I wrote PyZ3950 to support
<a href="http://www.pobox.com/~asl2/software/Tyrannio">Tyrannioware</a>,
my home book cataloging program.  The <a href="http://www.cheshire3.org/">Cheshire Project</a> at the <a href="http://www.liv.ac.uk">University
of Liverpool</a> adopted it, and I would like to acknowledge their financial
support and Rob Sanderson's contributions as co-developer.  The ASN.1 and Z39.50 modules are distributed together
partly for my convenience, and partly because the Z39.50 code may serve
as an illustration of the ASN.1 API.  (I wrote my own ASN.1 code because
I wanted its client to be able to use normal Python data types, and use
ASN.1 specifications run through the included compiler: neither <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pysnmp">
PySNMP</a> nor <a href="http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/software/pisces/">Pisces
</a> offer this.)  The only other Python Z39.50 implementation I know of
is part of a larger commercial product, 
<a href="http://www.bsn.com/Z39.50/wxPresso.html">wxPresso</a>.
<p>There's also a MARC module in zmarc.py (handles parsing only), and
a graphical <a href="http://zthes.z3950.org">Zthes</a> browser as
an example.</p>
<p>The software requires Python 2.2 or later, and is licensed under
the X licence (details in the files themselves), but the zoom
interface requires Dave Beazley's <a
href="http://systems.cs.uchicago.edu/ply/">PLY package</a>, licensed
under the LGPL.  Click <a href="PyZ3950-2.04.tar.gz">here</a> to
download version 2.04 of PyZ3950.  It's packaged with distutils, so
unzip and untar, and then
<code>python setup.py install</code>.  Most development has been done under
Linux, but I've tested briefly under Win98 (and, in theory, the code
should run anywhere Python runs).  The <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/tyrannioware">CVS</a> repository is at sourceforge.<p>


<H1>ZOOM</H1><p><a href="zoom.html">Link to pydoc documentation for zoom
        implementation (recommended interface).</a><H1>z3950</H1><p>PyZ3950 currently is capable of sending and receiving v2 or v3 PDUs
Initialize, Search, Present, Scan, Sort, Close, and Delete.  For client
work, you probably want to use ZOOM, which should be in the same
distribution as this file, in zoom.py.  The Server class in this file
implements a server, but could use some work.  Both interoperate with
the <a href="http://www.indexdata.dk/yaz"> Yaz toolkit</a> and the
client interoperates with a variety of libraries.  <p>

<H1>asn1</H1><p>asn1 is a relatively general-purpose ASN.1 BER encoder and decoder.
Encoding and
decoding functions  (asn1.encode and asn1.decode) take an ASN.1 spec, and
transform back and forth between a byte stream and what I consider a natural
Python representation of the data.
<p>Separating the ASN.1 specification from the code would allow 
compilation of the specification to inline Python or C code, or to a
specification for a C-based engine.
<p>This module supports the following ASN.1 types:
<ul>
<li>BOOLEAN - encoder takes any Python value, decoder produces 0 or 1</li>
<li>INTEGER - as in Python</li>
<li>BITSTRING - asn1.BitStringVal</li>
<li>OCTSTRING - Python string</li>
<li>NULL - ignore value on encoding, return None on decoding</li>
<li>REAL - asn1.REAL (I hope to make this look more like python floats someday: read the source if you need this)</li>
<li>OID - OidVal</li>
<li>EXTERNAL - as SEQUENCE, see below (or read the source)</li>
<li>all string types - Python string (no validity checking is done)</li>
</ul>
<p>For all the above types, the ASN.1 spec is just the name of the type.
Inherently constructed types:
<ul>
<li>SEQUENCE_OF (ASN1.spec) - Python representation is a list of values.</li>
<li>
SEQUENCE, CHOICE - the ASN.1 spec is a list of tuples, either (name, tag, type)
or, for SEQUENCE, (name, tag, type, optionalflag), where:
tag can be None, asn1.EXPLICIT(tag), asn1.IMPLICIT(tag), or an integer
interpreted as either an explicit or an implicit tag according to the setting
of asn1.implicit_default; type is recursively an ASN.1 spec.</li>
</ul>
<p>For CHOICE, the Python representation is (name, val).  For SEQUENCE, on
decoding,
the Python representation is an instance of an asn1-synthesized class.
On encoding, any class with the appropriate attributes is acceptable,
calling the SEQUENCE specification but you
can obtain a fresh instance of the synthesized class by calling the SEQUENCE
specification: this class overrides setattr to provide attribute-name error
checking.  (The rationale for the seemingly unPythonic errorchecking is that
misspelled optional attributes would otherwise be hard to detect.  If you don't
like it, it should be easy to turn off.)
<p>
The definition of enumerated values for INTEGER and BITSTRING types is
supported via the compiler (or see their definitions). For
BITSTRING types, __getitem__ (value_name) and __setitem__
(value_name) are implemented as BitStringVal methods, allowing,
e.g., <code>bitstringval['version_1'] = 1</code>, or <code>
if bitstringval['version_1']</code>.  An appropriate BitStringVal for
encoding can be constructed by calling the specification.
For INTEGER types, call <code>get_num_from_name (name)</code> or
<code>get_name_from_num(num) </code> methods of the type specification.
(Note that code like <code>if val == defn.get_num_from_name ('failure'):</code>
is less prone to typo-induced errors than <code> if
failure' == defn.get_name_from_num (val):</code>
<p>
In order to obtain definitions nested inside other definitions
(e.g. INTEGER and BITSTRING, above), __getitem__ methods are provided
for SEQUENCE, CHOICE, and SEQUENCE_OF.  For SEQUENCE and CHOICE, the
key is the name of the sequence element or arm (respectively).
For SEQUENCE_OF, the key is 0 (arbitrarily chosen).
<p>
APPLICATION and PRIVATE class tags are supported via the compiler,
or pass the <code>cls=</code> keyword to IMPLICIT or EXPLICIT.
<p>
For examples, see the test code at the end of this file, or the
Z39.50 code that should be distributed with this file as part of PyZ3950.
<p>
There is not yet support for:
<ul>
<li>UTCTime, SET, SET OF, or some more obscure types</li>
</ul>
